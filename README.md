   # Code Challenge 1 

## Description
The files in this folder consist of three of the code challenges given by the school for the end of the first week of Phase 1.

These challenges consist: bodaFareCalculator, chaiCalculator and moblieMoneyEstimator 

The challenges were done in Javascript shown in each files' respective Javascript files.

A HTML document was used to diplay console results and after enough testing the codes were working well and are well commented.
